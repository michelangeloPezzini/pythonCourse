 After your logic to determine the grade letter, add another section to determine the sign. Save this sign into a variable. Then, display both the grade letter and the sign in one print statement. 

Hint: To get the last digit, you could divide the number by 10, and get the remainder. You might refer back to the preparation material for Lesson 03 to see the operators and find the one that does division and gives you the remainder.
